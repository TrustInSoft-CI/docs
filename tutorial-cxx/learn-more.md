To learn about all the specifics of C++ analysis using TrustInSoft products including TrustInSoft CI, [read this page](https://man.trust-in-soft.com/man/tis-user-guide/tis-analyzer-plusplus.html).

You will be sent to the TrustInSoft Analyzer documentation, our on-premise product: TrustInSoft Analyzer++ is the version of TrustInSoft Analyzer for C++ and `tis-analyzer++` is the command to invoke it.

You will see some command line options such as `-cxx-demangling-full` or `-cxx-keep-mangling`. These options are either undocumented or not supported yet in TrustInSoft CI.

Feel free to reach out to us if you want to know more!
