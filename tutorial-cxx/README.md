# C++ tutorial

In this tutorial, we will review the analysis results of a simple C++ project using TrustInSoft CI Analyzer. The objective is to highlight C++ specificities, that will help you navigate your C++ analysis results and track the origin of undefined behaviors.

At the end of the tutorial, we will link to another page that go through the C++ specificities in more details.

This tutorial assumes that you know how to use [TrustInSoft CI Analyzer](../tutorial/find-the-root-cause-of-the-undefined-behaviors.md#launch-trustinsoft-ci-analyzer) so we strongly recommend that you read first our [introduction tutorial](../tutorial/) before going through this one.

Let's start by taking a look at our C++ project and some prerequisites!
