# Documentation

This documentation assists **C and C++ developers** in getting started with [TrustInSoft CI](https://ci.trust-in-soft.com/).

TrustInSoft CI is an **online source code analyzer** that continuously detects [undefined behaviors](faq.md#what-is-an-undefined-behavior) in C and C++ programs \(crash, arbitrary code execution, ...\).

Because it relies on the latest [formal methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_methods), TrustInSoft CI can detect the **most subtle undefined behaviors**, even when applied to well-tested code that has never revealed any problem. TrustInSoft CI also comes with a **powerful debugging interface** that helps developers easily find the **root cause of undefined behaviors**.
