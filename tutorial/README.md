If you are a **C or C++ developer, this tutorial is for you** as it will help you **get started with TrustInSoft CI.** TrustInSoft CI is ****an online source code analyzer for C and C++ that relies on the latest [formal methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_methods).

In this tutorial, you will learn how to:

1. **Set up the continuous analysis of a project**
2. **Find the root cause of undefined behaviors** using TrustInSoft CI Analyzer
3. **Prove the absence of undefined behaviors** on the project tests

In its initial version, TrustInSoft CI can only analyze **public projects hosted on GitHub**, so as a requirement, you should have or be willing to create a GitHub account.

Let's get started!
